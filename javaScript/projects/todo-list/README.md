5. Edit project name.
6. :heav_check_mark: Rewrite priority selection into a list with a hidden input.

### Questions
1. How do we distinguish a single step versus a single responsibility?
2. How to find the depth of object properties and use the depth value to tranverse through object properties?
3. Is it worth creating modules for individual elements (ex, button elements)?
4. Does exporting/importing a module use memory? If so, how?
5. Is it less efficient removing/adding an element than updating the element's contents? For example, adding and removing `#projects_list`.  
6. What is the point, if any, using an object literal pattern when using ES6 modules?
7. Is there a way to style all elements except for elements with SVG childs?
