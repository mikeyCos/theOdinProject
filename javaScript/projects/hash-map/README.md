## Live preview: [Hash Map](https://mikeycos.github.io/theOdinProject/javaScript/projects/hash-map/dist)
---
### Ideas
1. Implement a user interface.
---
### Notes
*  The Hashmap factory function is declared globally in `index.js`.
* A Hashmap object named `foo` is declared globally in `index.js`.
---
### Instructions
1. Click on [Hash Map](https://mikeycos.github.io/theOdinProject/javaScript/projects/hash-map/dist)
2. Open browser's DevTools and go to the console.
3. In the browser's console:
  * Enter `const variableName = new HashMap()`.
  * The current available LinkedList methods:
    * `hash(key)`, takes a value and produces a hash code with it.
    * `entries()`, returns an array that contains each key, value pair. For example, `[[firstKey, firstValue], [secondKey, secondValue]]`.
    * `set(key, value)`, takes two arguments, the first is a key and the second is a value that is assigned to this key. If a key already exists, then the old value is overwritten.
    * `get(key)`, takes one argument as a key and returns the value that is assigned to this key. If key is not found, return null.
    * `has(key)`, takes a key as an argument and returns true or false based on whether or not the key is in the hash map.
    * `remove(key)`, If the given key is in the hash map, it should remove the entry with that key and return true. If the key isnâ€™t in the hash map, it should return false.
    * `length()`, returns the number of stored keys in the hash map.
    * `clear()`, removes all entries in the hash map.
    * `keys()`, returns an array containing all the keys inside the hash map.
    * `values()`, returns an array containing all the values.
    * `indexOf(key)`, returns the index of the bucket that the key belongs to.
