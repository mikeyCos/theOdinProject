* The official solutions put all changes at the end of the CSS file, which may duplicate some selectors (e.g. there might be a body {} in the given CSS, and another body {} in the solution). When you are working on an exercise, it is best practice to add your CSS to existing selectors instead of duplicating them at the end of the file. We're sacrificing this best practice in our official solutions to make it extra clear to you what things we changed to solve the exercise.
* Unless listed in the self-check section, do not worry about getting the exact pixel value for things like margin, padding and font-size. These exercises are intended to test your knowledge of CSS, not your ability to guess that a screenshot is using font: sans-serif bold 16px, or that the margin is exactly 42px.
* You may need to add some elements to your HTML to get things into the right spot. (For the first few exercises we make it explicit when this needs to happen.)
* You may need to add more selectors to your CSS file. The first few exercises have almost everything already done for you, but as you progress you'll find that you need to add more and more to get the correct result.
