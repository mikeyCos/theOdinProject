07 APR 2023: '1 + 2 =' returns 3, pressing 'Enter/=' again returns 5 (ie. 3 + 2). If user presses '+' then 'Enter/=' returns 10 (ie. 5 + 5), and if '+' then 'Enter/=' keys are pressed again, then 20 is returned (ie. 10 + 10). Now, if user presses only '=' then 30 is returned (ie. 20 + 10). Implemented subtraction/multiplication/division operations, delete key will revert all variables to initial values, testing backspace implementation, and repeating an operation after entering a number will perform the pressed operator. '2 + 3' then pressing '+' returns 5, and pressing '7' then '+' will return 12 (ie. 5 + 7 = 12).  
06 APR 2023: Restarted project.  
04 APR 2023: Able to store 2 numbers at a time, pressing '=' or 'Enter' after addition will continue to add the current sum by the original value added, and the sum replaces the first initial value.  
03 APR 2023: Initialized basic HTML, CSS, JS files.
